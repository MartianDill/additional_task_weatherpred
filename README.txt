Weather Forecasting

This project is being divided into two modules, Data Gathering & Pre-processing, and Prediction Algorithm. This project would be based on prediction and that’s why data needs to be prepared in a structured way. For this, you can either be parsing or one-hot encoding. It’s best to implement Scikit-Learn (linear regression) model to train the datasets and once they’re trained you can provide inputs (temp, pressure, etc.)

This app is well-capable in predicting 6-7 days (up to) data sets and will fetch weather details on an hourly basis. It will also offer users to change location and measurements as per their choices. 

Key Features:

1. This project would require Linear Regression to predict the amount of Rainfall (in cm).
2. This project will take certain parameters to measure weather i.e. temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
3. Software requirement – Python/Java/C++/Rust/JavaScript/etc.
